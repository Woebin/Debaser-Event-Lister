This is a simple MVC app to list events taking place at Debaser venues within the selected timeframe.
Known issues:
* Some combinations of venues will not return correct results. I've spent a decent chunk of time troubleshooting this and testing different combinations, and believe it to be a problem with Debaser's API rather than with this app.
* The design of the whole thing is very basic, but I guess that's fine.
* The code itself is probably, for lack of a better word, ugly. Everything this does can definitely be done better if one spends the time to do so.
